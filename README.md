Welcome to the Club Penguin Music Wiki Engine repository!

The Club Penguin Music Wiki aims to provide extensive accurate information about everything related to the music of the franchise.

The engine is the underlying software that allows users to see and edit the data, while the actual information is stored within a database, administered outside this repository,
though the aim is to make all information readily available.
